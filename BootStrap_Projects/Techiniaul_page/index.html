                     <p class='lead fs-6'>Linux is an open-source operating system like other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS, iOS, Google android, etc. An operating system is a software that enables the communication between computer hardware and software. It conveys input to get processed by the processor and brings output to the hardware to display it. This is the basic function of an operating system. Although it performs many other important tasks, let's not talk about that.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Linux is around us since the mid-90s. It can be used from wristwatches to supercomputers. It is everywhere in our phones, laptops, PCs, cars and even in refrigerators. It is very much famous among developers and normal computer users.

                     Evolution of Linux OS</h5>
                     <p class='lead fs-6'>The Linux OS was developed by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds' target='_blank'> Linus Torvalds </a> in 1991, which sprouted as an idea to improve the UNIX OS. He suggested improvements but was rejected by UNIX designers. Therefore, he thought of launching an OS, designed in a way that could be modified by its users.
                        Nowadays, Linux is the fastest-growing OS. It is used from phones to supercomputers by almost all major hardware devices.
                     </p>
                     <h5 class='lead fw-bold fs-3 mt-4'>How Does Linux Work ?</h5>
                     <p class='lead fs-6'>Think about an OS like a car engine. An engine can run on its own, but it becomes a functional car when it’s connected with a transmission, axles, and wheels. Without the engine running properly, the rest of the car won’t work.
                        Linux was designed to be similar to UNIX, but has evolved to run on a wide variety of hardware from phones to supercomputers. Every Linux-based OS involves the Linux kernel—which manages hardware resources—and a set of software packages that make up the rest of the operating system.
                        The OS includes some common core components, like the GNU tools, among others. These tools give the user a way to manage the resources provided by the kernel, install additional software, configure performance and security settings, and more
                     </p>
                     <h5 class='lead fw-bold fs-3 mt-4'>What is a command line</h5>
                     <p class='lead fs-6'>The command line is your direct access to a computer. It's where you ask software to perform hardware actions that point-and-click graphical user interfaces (GUIs) simply can't ask. 
                        Command lines are available on many operating systems—proprietary or open source. But it’s usually associated with Linux, because both command lines and open source software, together, give users unrestricted access to their computer.
                        Our latest release of <a href='https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-linux' target='_blank'> Red Hat® </a> Enterprise Linux comes with even more built-in command line capabilities than ever before and includes consoles that bundle those capabilities in easy-to-use modules that exist off of the command line.

Mint has dropped support for 32-bit versions and is only available in 64-bit.

                                 <p class='lead fs-6'>The OpenSUSE project is a modern and comprehensive community project that provides 2 main SUSE branches: SUSE Leap which is a point release that targets desktop users as well as enterprise development and for testing purposes. This makes it a perfect choice for open source developers and System administrators. On the other hand, it has SUSE Tumbleweed, a rolling release that packs the latest software stacks and IDEs and is the closest you’ll get to a bleeding-edge distro. TumbleWeed is any power user’s or software developer’s piece of cake thanks to the availability of up-to-date packages such as office applications, GCC compiler, and the kernel.
